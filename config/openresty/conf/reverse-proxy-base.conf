# Enable retrying the next upstream on failure
# Important to limit the number of tries and possibly
# the timeout otherwise a single request which triggers an error could take down all the servers
# We do rolling deploys where one server is taken down at a time so this should allow 
# a failover in that case. Expensive or bug-triggering requests should consistently failwhale
# You have to be careful that these error codes are only returned when the server is truly
# unavailable – I ran into a nasty bug where a request that should have lead to a 404 was return
# a 500 error code, and this config considered the upstream server bad!
# I removed 'timeout' from this proxy_next_upstream config – does that help?

# you could also add 'non_idempotent' to retry POST requests, by default nginx won't 
# retry these. but this might lead to weird behaviour. right now it causes certain
# dropbox webhooks to return 502 during the deployment of new code. might also fail
# certain form submissions too... are these endpoints all idempotent? if so then enable.
