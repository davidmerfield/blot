// Entries.getPage a second time. This does mean a plain {{#entries}} view
// now inherits posts()'s ?tag=/:tag filtering, which the old raw getPage
// call here ignored - accepted as part of standardizing on posts() as the
// single fetch path. See https://github.com/davidmerfield/blot/issues/1844
