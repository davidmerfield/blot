Guide to debugging issues on remote server:

ssh into the server:

ssh macserver

use VNC viewer to log into remote server

browse error logs:

pm2 logs -e macserver

Guide to running this client locally:

use the script:

npm run deploy-localmacserver

if needed, ssh into the localmacserver:

ssh localmacserver

and then start pm2:

cd ~/blot/app/clients/icloud/macserver

pm2 start ...

when initially setting up the client, you need to switch users to press on the 'accept icloud sharing link' prompt manually since macos doesn't seem to allow a background gui process (required by the applescript). this can be fiddly to get right but once connected it's fairly smooth.
