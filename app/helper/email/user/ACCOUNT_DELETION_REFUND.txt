Refund

I noticed you signed up for Blot but deleted your account soon after. 

I’ve processed a refund for your payment, which should appear on your original payment method within a few business days.

Did you run into any issues using Blot? I’d appreciate any feedback or suggestions for improvement.

Sincerely, David
