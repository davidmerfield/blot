Issue with Blot?

I noticed you signed up for Blot and later cancelled.

Did you run into any issues, or was there something you expected Blot to do that it didn’t?

If Blot isn’t right for you, deleting your account before the end of the billing period will automatically trigger a full refund.

Sincerely, David
