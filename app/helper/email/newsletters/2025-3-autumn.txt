**New features**
- Blot can now extract [EXIF metadata](https://blot.im/how/files/images#exif) from photos. You can display details about the camera, lens and exposure settings [in your template](https://blot.im/developers/reference#.exif). You’ll need to enable this feature for existing sites on the [publishing settings page](https://blot.im/sites/settings/publishing).
- You can now [publish HEIC photos](https://blot.im/how/files/images) directly as posts. This format is used by iPhones.
- Obsidian-style [media embedding](https://blot.im/how/formatting/wikilinks#embedding-files-with-obsidian) is now possible. For example, `![[image.png]]` turns into an image.
- Wikilinks can now match [headings on the same page](https://blot.im/how/formatting/wikilinks#how-are-wikilinks-resolved). For example, `[[#Apple]]` will link to the heading 'Apple' on the same page.
- You can now add blockquotes to posts and pages created from [Google Docs](https://blot.im/how/files/google-docs).

**Changes**
- Blot’s [source code](https://blot.im/source-code) is now [licensed under the GPL](https://blot.im/questions/3053) instead of the CC0.
- Links to files in your site’s folder are now delivered via our CDN, improving your site’s loading speed.
- The [Google Drive](https://blot.im/how/sync/google-drive) and [iCloud](https://blot.im/how/sync/icloud) setup processes were rewritten with new setup pages and improved disconnect/reset reliability.
- The hosting infrastructure has been hardened with rate-limiting, fail2ban automation, and new blocking rules to protect your site and the dashboard from a large increase in bot and scraper traffic over the last few months.
- Blot can now preserve single line breaks in [Google Docs](https://blot.im/how/files/google-docs).
- Preload metadata is added to audio and video tags by default.
- [Vimeo embeds](https://blot.im/how/formatting/embedding) now get full size thumbnails, as opposed to the lower resolution thumbnail previously loaded.
- We updated Blot’s dependencies to patch known security vulnerabilities and made changes to the dashboard and documentation, per tradition.

**Bug fixes**
- [YAML metadata](https://blot.im/how/metadata) works in [Google Docs](https://blot.im/how/files/google-docs).
- [Images](https://blot.im/how/files/markdown#images) referenced using windows-style backslash paths now work.
- [Bandcamp embeds](https://blot.im/how/formatting/embedding) render reliably again—including inside Word documents—after refining the embed parser.
- The [exporter](https://blot.im/sites/settings/export) now encodes HTML in posts correctly when you export your site to Wordpress.

**Questions**
- [Adding time or tags to photos?](https://blot.im/questions/1440)
- [What new methods of syncing a folder would you like?](https://blot.im/questions/1387)
- [What have you made with Blot?](https://blot.im/questions/1635)

**Mistakes**
- We struggled significantly with increased bot traffic over the summer. Some of these attacks crashed our servers repeatedly in June. We now have improved defenses in place and [the servers are stable](https://status.blot.im/). It did help us identify slow areas in the code that render your site’s pages. We have lots of work over the next few months to make these processes faster.
- There was a major issue with subfolder syncing on [iCloud](https://blot.im/how/sync/icloud) which appeared as the number of people using iCloud increased. It took too long to work out how to fix the issue, but it is now resolved.

**Plans for the winter**
- Improve the templates, especially their mobile experience.
- Fix the template editor and improve the developer documentation.
- Increase the performance and reliability of the renderer for your sites.
