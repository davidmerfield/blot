<p><span>The next morning at my enclave in Saigon, I stopped by the neighborhood coffee shop . As I picked up my coffee, I casually remarked that I was hungry - this shop does not serve food, and it was a bit too early for the other eateries in the neighborhood to open. </span><br>

<span>Two minutes into my coffee, a plate of toasted bread and a dollop of cream decorated with chocolate appeared in front of me. The kindly owner explained that she didnâ€™t want me to be hungry so she just fixed whatever she could. I love free food, it feels like home.</span></p>
