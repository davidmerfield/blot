I tend to think of these terms as commonly known, but often find they're limited to a smaller community. So here's some jargon I find myself using.

**Bike-shedding** - arguing about insignificant, especially stylistic details (e.g. what color to paint the bike shed).

**Rubber-ducking** - Explaining an idea to someone or something (e.g. a rubber duck) to gain insight and clarity

**Yak Shaving** - Doing work tangentially (at best) related to the intended task.

**Shotgun surgery** - Pejorative description of needing to make many small, nearly mechanical changes to many different files in a codebase in order to accomplish something conceptually straightforward

**LGTM** - Looks good to me. LG for short.

**SGTM** - Sounds good to me. SG for short.

**TIL** - Today I Learned

**PTAL** - Please take another look - said when a round of feedback on a doc or code change has been addressed and it is ready for another.
