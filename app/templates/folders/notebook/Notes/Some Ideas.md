# Some Ideas

Complaining about low quality or missing documentation is often better understood as a complaint about high complexity.

A great many systems should care about performance a bit more from the get-go. Especially when it comes to choosing the fundamental architecture, data structures, language and runtime of your system.

Notions of quality are not well captured by common sprint-planning processes.

Often doing the hard, technically ambitious thing is not as hard as people think, and pays large dividends. This can also be true for projects that involve a lot of "grunt work".

Code review is one of your best tools for improving code quality, but code reviews should be fast and specific.
