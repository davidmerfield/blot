- Notion's easy block based editor and attention to graphic design
- Roam's modernization of Wiki-style [[backlinks]] and novel daily log
- Obsidian's simple architecture and publishing flow

I wish there were an easy way to SSO-gate some sections of my notes, so I could more easily share thoughts about work-related concepts.
