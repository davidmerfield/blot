[Giftr](https://apps.sandstorm.io/app/tr3w5p7ajsf61nf2e6dkfv8tdjes0qsm5w6ew0frd4qwnacwur90) is a small gift list app that I wrote for my family to help out with Christmas.

The idea—all credit to my mom—is for every person to have a list where other folks can comment
or coordinate on what gift to get them, but without the recipient seeing.

I've re-written it once a year or so for fun. In this version, I wrote it as an app for [Sandstorm](https://sandstorm.io/).

Hope someone out there finds it useful!
