# How I Persuade

I don't know how _you_ can persuade people—it always depends on the question, the audience, the culture. But in this document, I'll summarize what I've found effective in my career, and in my life. 

## Be right

Persuading others is easiest when you're right. So it's worth doing your homework first—what makes you think you've seen reality clearly? How would you know if you were wrong? What else is possible, or what else could explain the evidence you do have?

It's also unpleasant to persuade people, and then turn out to be wrong, or even just have a lingering worry that you might be. So try your best to get it right.

If you're not sure what's right, or what you believe, then you're not ready to persuade people yet.

## Say it

If you don't say it, they won't hear it. Condense your message down to a few words, and make that the title of the document or the subject of the email. Then say it again in the opening sentence, and most of the opening paragraph, too.

It's not just important that the message be short, but that it be plain, and confident: no hedging, no throat clearing. You've seen reality accurately, so you should state it as plainly as if you were describing your own hand when it's right in front of your face.

## Create an image

Try to create a visual that captures the main point. Especially if the ideas are abstract, representing them by analogy to objects will help people internalize your view. Don't be afraid to use a few simple diagrams on the page, even just to illustrate the metaphor, even if it seems a bit ridiculous.

## Make a pyramid

The title of the document should express your point in a few words. The first sentence should express the exact same point in more words. Those are the top two layers of your pyramid. Then the first paragraph, and the rest of the document form the bottom two.

If you're having a hard time expressing your idea in a sentence or a few words, that might mean you haven't quite figured out what you want to say. Take it as an opportunity to focus and clarify your thinking: when you know what you want to say, the words will be there.

## Sign-post

Similar to how you need to state your main point clearly, it's helpful to do the same with all of your subsidiary points: The adage goes, "tell them what you're going to tell them, tell them, tell them what you told them". That's called sign-posting. It can sound a bit awkward at times, but it helps people understand your point.

## Defeat objections

Often an idea is competitive with a number of alternative explanations or possibilities. It's worth taking the time to state them explicitly, compellingly, and then explain why they don't make sense, or how you know they're wrong.

Defeating objections requires representing the alternatives well, and being clear about the tradeoffs your approach endorses. Doing justice to the other side won't undermine you—it will make you credible.

## Remove the rest

Every word you write makes it more likely that people start skimming. If you've got a version of the email or essay you like, take a pass over each sentence, and each word. Remove anything that doesn't directly make your case. Even for the parts that do, cut the fat.

It's common to have some readers who want more detail and some who just want the punchline. If you need to include something extra, or need to show your work, create an appendix section at the end of your doc and put it there. The people who are looking for it will find it.
