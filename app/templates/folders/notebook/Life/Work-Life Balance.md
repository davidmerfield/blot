# Work-Life balance is about what matters

A naive interpretation of the notion of work/life balance might weigh a balance of time or energy: work during working hours, but leave it behind outside of that time, and disconnect completely when you’re on vacation.

That’s sensible, but too simple.

Most of us get more out of work than a salary:

- A sense of pride, self-worth and usefulness
    
- Self-growth and development, personal and professional
    
- Meaningful social relations and belonging in a community
    
- Pursuit of one’s interests, passion, or curiosity
    
- A sense of structure and rhythm in life
    
- The ability to make a positive contribution to the world
    

The issue of what work does and should mean to us is both political and personal. I’m going to write here within the frame of “work/life balance” and how I think about it, leaving some of those larger questions aside.

I get some blend of the above aspects of non-monetary value out of work. Often they are the things that motivate me to “go above and beyond”—to put more of my resources into work than I otherwise would. This looks like coming in on the weekend, or evenings, or just staying intensely focused while at the office.

In fact, over my career, many of the times I was happiest at work, and often overall, I was working hard: I was doing it because I cared, it felt meaningful or well-motivated to me, it connected me to others, or it was fun.

On the other hand, I’ve also had some of my most frustrating, stressful and difficult times at work while working hard. Maybe I was dealing with security incidents or outages, or maybe I was just doing boring or meaningless work.

If I am working hard, the first question is: “why?”

- Because I’m having fun, the work is meaningful, or connects me to others
    
- Because I feel insecure in my position, and working hard soothes my anxiety
    
- Because my main focus in life right now is achieving my professional goals
    
- Because I am stressed: if I don’t it will have a big negative impact
    
- Because my manager or coworker told me I have to, and I agree with their reasoning
    
- Because my manager or coworker told me I have to, even though it doesn’t make sense to me
    
- Because the rest of my life is difficult, and work helps me avoid dealing with it
    
- Because the rest of my life is difficult, and work provides a much-needed respite
    

If I’m comfortable with the answer to that question, I might consider resilience—am I “balanced”?

- Are my relationships with my community, friends, family, or romantic partner getting what they need?
    
- Am I connected to my non-work interests and passions?
    
- Am I physically mentally or spiritually well?
    

If I’m working relatively little, likewise the first question is “why?”

- My attention is elsewhere: my life is exciting outside of work, and my energy is going there
    
- I’m highly effective, and don’t need much time to have a big impact
    
- There’s little need for my work right now—we’re waiting for something happen, so it’s a good time to take a break
    
- I am disengaged: work is uninteresting or meaningless
    
- I am overwhelmed: I’ve been asked to do something beyond my reach
    
- I am disconnected: nobody pays attention to what I do anyway, so who cares?
    
- I’m overwhelmed by other events in my life
    
- I feel anxious about failing, so I’m avoiding work entirely
    

If I’m comfortable with the answer to that question, I might consider resilience here as well:

- Is my workplace or are my coworkers getting what they need from me?
    
- Am I over-indexed on a new activity, relationship, or situation?
    

Depending on the unique situation I’m in, there might be different appropriate responses, some of which my manager or my company might nudge me towards, and others that I need to address outside of work.

To me, maintaining work/life balance means:

1. There’s an appropriate connection between the value work provides, and the amount you’re working.
    
2. Your life is resilient to the ordinary ups and downs of being alive
    

## Answering the cynics

This all might seem a bit much: Isn’t work really just about making money so you can survive? Isn’t this just feel-good gloss on the brutal realities of capitalist exchange?

Consider first that nearly all of our relationships involve navigating economic exchange to some extent: how do you split a check at dinner with friends? How do you make financial decisions as a family? What are the relevant gifting protocols or party-payment expectations?

It is not a fantasy to believe that genuinely meaningful relationships may even have an economic exchange at their core. The economic exchange may give shape to the relationship, but authentic human connection can comfortably coexist.

In On Becoming A Person, Carl Rogers writes about what he’s experienced as a therapist. He believes that most people, given an appropriate environment, will move towards pro-social and pro-self beliefs and behaviors. And that the role of the therapist is to provide that environment: to be a ladder someone can use to climb towards their own light.

The workplace is no substitute for the community, the family, friends, therapy, or society. Each has its own unique place in a well-lived life, but our workplace can and should provide for each of us an environment we can use to grow and flourish as people, and ultimately play an important role in helping us become who we are. Work-life balance is necessary for that to happen—but only if we think about it in a way that gets at what matters.
