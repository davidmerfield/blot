# Socca

A thin pancake made from chickpea flour, eaten hot from the oven in Nice. It is best torn by hand and eaten immediately.

**Ingredients**
- 250 g chickpea flour
- 600 ml water
- 3 tbsp olive oil, plus extra for the pan
- 1 tsp salt
- Freshly ground black pepper

**Method**
1. In a bowl, whisk the flour with salt and water until smooth. Add olive oil and let rest for at least 1 hour.
2. Heat a large cast-iron pan or oven tray under a hot grill (250°C).
3. Brush the hot pan generously with oil, pour in a thin layer of batter, and return it under the grill.
4. Cook for 7–8 minutes until blistered and browned on the edges.  
   *Footnote: Socca should never be flipped. The top should char slightly.*
5. Sprinkle with pepper and serve immediately in torn pieces.
