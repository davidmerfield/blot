I’m a technologist and software engineer. I’m interested in databases, security, and climate change.


# Professional

I’m currently working as an engineer on performance at [Airtable](https://airtable.com/).

I started my career as a product manager at Google where I contributed to Now, Maps, and OAuth 2.0. After that, I was CTO of [Welkin Health](https://www.welkinhealth.com/), a healthcare CRM. I also spent a pandemic sabbatical year building [[aft]], an indie backend-as-a-service.

I have special expertise in building secure, performant, highly flexible systems like CRMs, or databases. I’m also experienced in [[Startup Security]].

# Personal

I live in San Francisco. I try to enjoy the beautiful nature all around the Bay Area, whether hiking, on my bike, or just keeping my eyes open.

This is my [[Personal Website]], where I keep a few essays, links to some projects I've done, and some other notes.

I facilitate a Bay Area [[Men's Group]]. I’m an advocate for a strong sense of ethics at technology companies, as well as making them accessible and welcoming to as many people as possible. I have a certain [[Perspective]] on life.
