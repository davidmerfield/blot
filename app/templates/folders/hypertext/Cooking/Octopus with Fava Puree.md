A Cycladic island classic. Tender octopus over a bed of silky yellow split peas purée.

**Ingredients**

1. Simmer the octopus in a covered pot with wine, bay leaf, and a splash of water for about 45 minutes until tender. Remove, cut into large pieces.
2. Rinse the split peas. Boil with diced onion and 750 ml water until soft (about 40 minutes), skimming foam occasionally.
