# Pollo alla Cacciatora

A Tuscan farmhouse dish of chicken stewed slowly in tomato, wine, and herbs. Each region has a version; this one keeps the sauce light so the meat remains distinct.

**Ingredients**
- 1 whole chicken, cut into pieces (about 1.5 kg)
- 2 tbsp olive oil
- 1 onion, finely chopped
- 2 cloves garlic, crushed
- 2 tbsp tomato paste
- 400 g chopped tomatoes
- 150 ml dry white wine
- 1 carrot, diced
- 1 celery stalk, diced
- 1 sprig rosemary
- 1 bay leaf
- Salt and black pepper

**Method**
1. Brown the chicken in olive oil over medium heat until golden on all sides. Remove and set aside.
2. In the same pan, add onion, carrot, and celery. Cook until soft and translucent.
3. Stir in tomato paste, then deglaze with white wine. Let it reduce by half.
4. Add chopped tomatoes, herbs, and the browned chicken. Cover and simmer gently for 40–45 minutes.
5. Remove the lid for the last 10 minutes to thicken the sauce. Adjust seasoning before serving with crusty bread.
