# Grilled Sardines with Lemon and Oregano

A simple Greek summer dish, often eaten by the sea.

**Ingredients**
- 8 fresh sardines, cleaned
- 2 tbsp olive oil
- 1 lemon
- 1 tsp dried oregano
- Salt, pepper

**Method**
1. Rinse and pat dry the sardines. Brush with oil, season with salt and oregano.
2. Grill for 2–3 minutes per side until skin blisters and flesh just flakes.
3. Squeeze lemon over the fish before serving.
4. *Footnote: Charcoal grilling adds essential flavour; a hot pan is the next best thing.*
