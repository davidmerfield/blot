Use git diff to perform a line-by-line review of this branch against master.

For each change, reconstruct the surrounding context (functions, call sites, and related files) and assess:

correctness and potential bugs (logic errors, edge cases, off-by-one, null/undefined paths)
unintended behavioral changes or regressions
API and function usage (signatures, contracts, invariants)
error handling, state management, and resource cleanup
performance implications and complexity changes
security or data-integrity risks, if applicable

Flag anything that is ambiguous, risky, or inconsistent with existing patterns. For each issue, provide:

the exact diff location
a concise explanation of the risk
a concrete suggestion or alternative implementation
Ignore formatting or stylistic changes unless they affect behavior. Prioritize correctness and maintainability over minor refactors.

Assume this code will be deployed to production. Treat unclear behavior as a potential bug. Prefer explicitness and backward compatibility. Don't create any files or make any changes yet, just flag issues for further investigation.
