Use git diff and git status to perform a line-by-line review of this branch against master, including uncomitted changes.

Don't create any files or make any changes, just flag issues for further investigation.

For each change, reconstruct the surrounding context (functions, call sites, and related files). 

Then assess the changes for:

- correctness and bugs (logic errors, edge cases, off-by-one, null/undefined paths)
- unintended behavioral changes or regressions
- API and function usage (signatures, contracts, invariants)
- error handling, state management, and resource cleanup
- security or data-integrity risks, if applicable

Don't be too nitpicky. 

Flag anything that is wrong, clearly risky, or inconsistent with existing patterns. Do not analyze code which is not changed. For each issue, provide:

- the exact diff location
- a concise explanation of the risk
- a concrete suggestion or alternative implementation
- Ignore formatting or stylistic changes unless they affect behavior. 
- Prioritize correctness and maintainability over minor refactors.

Assume this code will be deployed to production. Treat unclear behavior as a potential bug. Prefer explicitness and backward compatibility.
