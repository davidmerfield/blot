<h1>About</h1>

<p>Blot is a tool you can use to make a website. It's an open source publishing platform. Blot can generate a website from files and folders. The websites generated by Blot resemble those created by other content-management-systems. But there's no publishing interface, no forms to fill out. Just drag-and-drop. </p>

<h2>Why does Blot exist?</h2>

<p>
  We want to make it possible for people to contribute to the internet, to create their own website. Although Blot is simple – you can start with just a Word document or a text file, it is also powerful: you can eventually use all the full power of HTML, CSS and JavaScript. One of our goals is to revive the gentle on-ramp to the web that existed in the early days of the internet – on myspace, geocities, etc. We want to make it easy for people to start sharing their work with the world, and then give them the tools to grow their skills as they learn more about building for the web. We would like the internet to be more beautiful, more interesting, more human.</p>

  <h2>Why does Blot cost money?</h2>
  <p>
    Hosting your website costs money. Some services pay for this by selling your data, or by showing you ads, or by spending the money of investors.  We are entirely funded by our customers. There is no advertising and we have no investors.

<h2>How long has Blot been around?</h2>
