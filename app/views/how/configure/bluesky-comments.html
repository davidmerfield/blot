<h1>Bluesky comments</h1>

<p>
  Blot’s Bluesky comments plugin lets you embed the discussion for a Bluesky
  post at the end of any entry. The comments are rendered by the
  <a href="https://github.com/bluesky-social/bluesky-comments" rel="nofollow">Bluesky comments widget</a>
  and require the identifier of the Bluesky post you want to attach.
</p>

<ol>
  <li>Open the <a href="/settings/services">Services</a> page and enable <strong>Bluesky comments</strong>.</li>
  <li>
    Enter the default Bluesky handle you would like to use when loading the widget.
    This should usually be the author of the blog or the account responsible for the
    linked discussion.
  </li>
  <li>
    For every post that should show Bluesky comments, include a
    <code>Bluesky</code> field in the entry’s metadata set to the full post URI
    (for example <code>at://did:plc:example/app.bsky.feed.post/123</code>).
  </li>
</ol>

<p>
  Without the Bluesky metadata field the widget will not appear, even if the
  plugin is enabled. Comments remain hidden on pages unless you explicitly set
  <code>Comments: Yes</code> in the page metadata.
</p>

<p>
  You can combine the plugin with other comment systems and switch between them
  whenever you need from the Services page.
