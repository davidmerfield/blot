<h1>Wikilinks</h1>

<p>
  You can use wikilinks to create internal links between your posts. You can
  enable or disable wikilinks on the
  <a href="/settings/services">services page of your dashboard</a> under
  <em>Typography</em>.
</p>

<pre
  class="text with-chrome"
  title="Post.md"><code>This is a wikilink to a file called *Other post.md* in the same directory: 

[[Other post]]

The wikilink above is equivalent to this Markdown:

[Other post](/other-post)
</code></pre>

<h2>Why use Wikilinks?</h2>

<p>
  You don't need to know the URL of the linked post to create a wikilink, just
  the filename. Also, some note-taking applications, like
  <a href="https://obsidian.md/">Obsidian</a>, create and update wikilinks
  automatically.
</p>

<h2>How are Wikilinks resolved?</h2>

<p>At the moment, Blot looks up the linked post in the following order:</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    <strong>By file path</strong> When looking by file path, Blot first checks
    the contents of the wikilink as if it were a relative path, then an absolute
    path, and finally searches the directory containing your post by filename.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>By URL</strong> Works for posts and pages, is case-insensitive.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>By title</strong> Works for posts and pages, is case-insensitive.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>By heading anchor</strong> Blot supports linking to headings within
    the same post or page. The following wikilink forms are accepted and treated
    interchangeably: <code>[[Heading Title]]</code>,
    <code>[[#Heading Title]]</code>, <code>[[heading-id]]</code>, and
    <code>[[#heading-id]]</code>.
  </li>
</ol>

<pre><code>[[#My section heading]]</code></pre>

<p>
  The snippet above links directly to the <code>My section heading</code> heading
  in the current document.
</p>

<h2>Examples</h2>

<p>Consider the following folder structure</p>
<background class="green" style="margin: 0">
  <pre class="folder" title="Your site"><code>Introduction.docx
Fruits
  Apple.md  
  Pear.txt
  Tasty
    Mango.md
</code></pre>
</background>

<p>These are all valid Wikilinks for the files in the folder above:</p>

<table>
  <tr>
    <td><code class="file txt">Introduction.docx</code></td>
    <td>
      <pre><code>[[Fruits/Apple]]
[[./Fruits/Pear]]
[[/Fruits/Tasty/Mango.md]]</code></pre>
    </td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td><code class="file md">Apple.md</code></td>
    <td>
      <pre><code>[[Pear]]
[[./Tasty/Mango]]
[[/Introduction.docx]]</code></pre>
    </td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td><code class="file md">Mango.md</code></td>
    <td>
      <pre><code>[[Fruits/Apple]]
[[../Apple]]
</code></pre>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

<h2>Changing the link text</h2>

By default, the linked post's title will become the link's text. You can specify
your own text using the following syntax:

<pre><code>
[[Post.txt|Your link text here]]
</code></pre>

<h2>Tip for Obsidian</h2>

<p>
  For those who use <a href="https://obsidian.md/">Obsidian</a> to manage their
  notes, I recommend setting the <em>New link format</em> to
  <em>relative path to file</em>. Blot will work with the
  <em>New link format</em> set to <em>absolute path in vault</em> as long as
  your Obsidian Vault is not inside a subdirectory of your site folder on Blot.
</p>

<h2>Embedding files with Obsidian</h2>

<p>
  Obsidian lets you embed files such as images, audio, video, PDFs, and
  Markdown notes using the same wikilink syntax prefixed with an exclamation
  mark: <code>![[...]]</code>. Blot mirrors this behaviour and converts embeds
  into the correct HTML output when your site is built.
</p>

<p>
  You can embed any file that Blot already knows how to publish. This includes
  common image formats (<code>.png</code>, <code>.jpg</code>, <code>.jpeg</code>,
  <code>.gif</code>, <code>.svg</code>), audio (<code>.mp3</code>,
  <code>.wav</code>), video (<code>.mp4</code>, <code>.mov</code>), PDFs, and
  Markdown notes. Attachments from your Obsidian vault sync to Blot in the same
  folder structure, so embeds continue to work when your site is published.
</p>

<p>Here are some common examples of Obsidian-style embeds:</p>

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Intent</th>
    <th>Markdown</th>
    <th>Notes</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Image with custom alt text</td>
    <td><code>![[Garden/Flowers.png|Summer wildflowers]]</code></td>
    <td>
      The text after the pipe becomes the image's alt text on your published
      site.
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Relative path from the current note</td>
    <td><code>![[../Audio/Birds.mp3]]</code></td>
    <td>
      Uses a relative path to embed a file in a nearby folder. This mirrors
      Obsidian's <em>New link format → relative path to file</em> preference.
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Absolute path within the vault</td>
    <td><code>![[/Reference/Slides/Overview.pdf]]</code></td>
    <td>
      Works when Obsidian is configured to use <em>absolute path in vault</em>
      links. The leading slash points to the root of your site folder on Blot.
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Embed another note</td>
    <td><code>![[Project plan]]</code></td>
    <td>
      Inserts the rendered Markdown from another note inline. This is useful
      for reusing checklists, snippets, or reference material across pages.
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>
  When embedding Markdown notes, Blot renders the note's content inline on the
  page. Media files are rendered with the appropriate HTML element and include
  any alt text, captions, or titles that you add within Obsidian. If you prefer
  to keep embeds in a dedicated <code>attachments</code> folder, Obsidian's
  default attachment settings work without extra configuration—just make sure
  the folder is inside your blog directory so the files can sync to Blot.
