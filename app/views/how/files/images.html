<p>
  Put images directly into your site's folder and Blot will publish them as
  individual posts. Blot generates optimized versions to deliver to your
  readers. Use the path to add <a href="/how/metadata">tags</a> or change the
  <a href="/how/metadata">publication date</a>. Images in formats not widely
  supported on the web, such as TIFF, WebP, and AVIF, are automatically
  converted into PNG assets when published.
</p>

<h2>Compression and color profile</h2>
<p>Blot aims to compress your images as little as possible to preserve its quality. Blot also preserves the color profile of images when publishing them to your site and generating thumbnails.</p>

<background class="green">
  <pre class="folder" title="Your site"><code>Apple.jpeg
Banana.png
Cherry.gif
Trip to France
  _image.png  
  post.txt

</code></pre>
</background>

<h2>Ignore a file</h2>
<p>
  You can <a href="/how/posts#prevent-a-file-becoming-a-post"></a>prevent a file from becoming a post or page</p> if you
  start its name with an underscore. This is useful if you want to embed an
  image in <a href="/how/posts/markdown#images">Markdown post</a>.
</p>

<h2>Captioning an image</h2>
<p>
  Blot uses the image's filename, without its extension, to generate both the
  caption and the alt text for the image. If the filename ends with
  <code>@2x</code>, Blot adds the necessary retina markup to reference the
  higher-resolution asset automatically.
</p>

<h2>Change the date of an image post</h2>

<p>
  You can use the
  <a href="/how/metadata#set-the-publish-date-using-your-folder"
    >image's file name or its path</a
  >
  to set its date.
</p>

<h2>EXIF</h2>
<p>
  By default, Blot extracts selected EXIF metadata from image files that become posts. Your template can display this data if needed. The images served on your site have their EXIF removed to prevent leaking personal information.  
</p>
<p>You can change this setting on the <a href="/sites/settings/publishing">publish settings</a> page of your dashboard.</p>
<p>
