<p>
  Put images directly into your site's folder and Blot will publish them as
  individual posts. Blot generates optimized versions to deliver to your
  readers. Use the path to add <a href="/how/metadata">tags</a> or change the
  <a href="/how/metadata">publication date</a>. Images in formats not widely
  supported on the web, such as TIFF, WebP, and AVIF, are automatically
  converted into PNG assets when published.
</p>

<h2>Compression and color profile</h2>
<p>Blot aims to compress your images as little as possible to preserve its quality. Blot also preserves the color profile of images when publishing them to your site and generating thumbnails.</p>

<h2>Image metadata</h2>
<p>
  By default, Blot uses the <strong>Basic</strong> metadata mode for images. Basic
  retains common descriptive EXIF fields such as camera make and model while
  stripping sensitive details. Switch to <strong>Full</strong> mode to keep all
  available EXIF information, including GPS/location data, or choose
  <strong>Off</strong> to remove metadata entirely.
</p>
<p>
  You can change the metadata setting in <strong>Dashboard → Settings →
  Publishing</strong>. Any metadata you keep becomes available to templates via
  <code>entry.exif</code>; GPS coordinates and other location fields are only
  included when Full mode is enabled.

<h2>Ignore a file</h2>
<p>
  You can <a href="/how/posts#prevent-a-file-becoming-a-post"></a>prevent a file from becoming a post or page</p> if you
  start its name with an underscore. This is useful if you want to embed an
  image in <a href="/how/posts/markdown#images">Markdown post</a>.
</p>

<h2>Captioning an image</h2>
<p>
  Blot uses the image's filename, without its extension, to generate both the
  caption and the alt text for the image. If the filename ends with
  <code>@2x</code>, Blot adds the necessary retina markup to reference the
  higher-resolution asset automatically.
</p>

<h2>Change the date of an image post</h2>

<p>
  You can use the
  <a href="/how/metadata#set-the-publish-date-using-your-folder"
    >image's file name or its path</a
  >
  to set its date.
