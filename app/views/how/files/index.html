<h1>Files</h1>

<p>Files inside your folder become posts on your website. When you place a file that Blot can publish inside your folder, Blot will post it to your website.</p>

<h2>Update a post</h2>

<p>To edit a post, update its file. </p>

<h2>Combine multiple files</h2>

<p>
  Add a trailing plus sign to a folder's name (for example, <code>Essay+</code>)
  to publish every supported file inside it as a single entry. Blot merges their
  contents, metadata, dependencies, and statistics into one post located at the
  same path without the <code>+</code>. Draft folders behave the same way, so a
  folder such as <code>/drafts/Essay+</code> generates a single draft entry at
  <code>/drafts/Essay</code> and keeps its preview up to date.
</p>

<p>
  Only folders containing convertible files are published; empty <code>+</code>
  folders are ignored until you add a supported file.
</p>

<h2>Remove a post</h2>

<p>To delete a post, delete its file.</p>
