<h1>Word Documents</h1>

.docx &nbsp;.odt

<p>
  Supports files created by
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Word">Microsoft Word</a>,
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pages_(word_processor)">Pages</a>,
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Docs">Google Docs</a> and
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenOffice.org">OpenOffice</a>. Much
  formatting is stripped so posts match the style of your site.
</p>

<h2>Metadata</h2>

<p>
  Add <a href="/how/metadata">metadata</a> to your document by starting with a
  block of <code>key: value</code> pairs in the first paragraph or by inserting
  a <a href="/how/metadata#yaml">YAML front matter</a> block. Blot reads this
  information the same way it does for plain text posts, so fields like
  <code>Title</code>, <code>Date</code> and <code>Tags</code> are picked up
  automatically.
</p>

<h2>Headings</h2>

<p>
  Blot looks for bold text to determine the structure of the post. A bold line
  at the top becomes the post title, and additional bold paragraphs are turned
  into headings so the published page has a sensible outline.
</p>

<h2>Images and assets</h2>

<p>
  Blot extracts images embedded in the document and adds them directly to the
  post created from the Word file, so they appear in the same place as they did
  in your document.
</p>

<h2>Formatting cleanup</h2>

<p>
  Inline styles and unused tags are removed during conversion. This keeps the
  post lightweight and lets your site's theme control the final appearance.
