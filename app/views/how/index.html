<h1>Getting started</h1>

<p style="margin-top: 0;">Blot creates a website from a folder. Files in the folder become posts or pages on your site. You update your site by adding, removing, or editing files directly.</p>


<p>You can use Blot to build many types of sites, including blogs, photo galleries, and portfolios. </p>

<p>Because Blot uses a file-based workflow, it works with the tools you already use—including your favorite text editor.

<h2>Subfolders</h2>
<p>You can organize your folder however you like. By default, files inside becomes posts. However, Blot treats files in the following folders differently:</p>
{{> sub_folder_list}}

<h2>Your folder is public</h2>

<p>All of the files in your site’s folder are public. This is useful if you want to embed an image, a video or an audio file in a post. You can also share files with your readers. For example, given the folder below, your readers can download <em>Archive.zip</em> if they visit <em>/Files/Archive.zip</em> on your site.</p>
