<h1>Obsidian</h1>

<h2>Create a website with Obsidian</h2>

<p>
  Obsidian is a Markdown note-taking app that uses plain files stored on your
  computer. Because Blot turns folders of files into websites, the two work
  well togetherâ€”just point Blot at the same folder you use as your Obsidian
  vault.
</p>

<h3>Recommended settings</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    Set <strong>New link format</strong> to <em>relative path to file</em>. Blot
    also understands <em>absolute path in vault</em> if your vault is the root of
    your blog folder.
  </li>
  <li>
    Keep your attachments in a folder inside the vault (Obsidian's default
    <code>attachments</code> location works). Blot mirrors this folder structure
    when publishing your site.
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Blot features for Obsidian users</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Wikilinks</strong>: Blot resolves <code>[[Links]]</code> using the
    same filename logic as Obsidian. You can customise the link text with the
    <code>[[Page name|Custom text]]</code> syntax.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Embeds</strong>: Obsidian's <code>![[...]]</code> syntax works for
    images, audio, video, PDFs, and notes. Alt text after the pipe (for example
    <code>![[File.png|Caption]]</code>) becomes the published <code>alt</code>
    attribute.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Markdown notes as components</strong>: Embedding another note (for
    example <code>![[Project overview]]</code>) renders the Markdown inline on
    your site, so you can reuse content in multiple posts.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  See the <a href="/how/formatting/wikilinks">wikilinks guide</a> for detailed
  examples of how embeds and link resolution behave when your notes are
  published with Blot.
