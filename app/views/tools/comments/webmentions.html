<h1>Webmentions</h1>

<p>
  Webmentions let you collect replies, likes, and reposts from other sites.
  Blot's Webmentions plugin uses <a href="https://webmention.io/">webmention.io</a>
  to fetch those conversations and show them beneath your posts.
</p>

<h2>Set up webmention.io</h2>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>
      Visit <a href="https://webmention.io/">webmention.io</a> and sign in with one
      of the supported providers.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Add your site's domain (for example, <code>example.com</code>) to your
      webmention.io account. Follow the prompts to verify ownership of the domain
      &mdash; webmention.io will ask you to add a short verification token to your
      site before continuing.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      In the webmention.io dashboard, ensure that <strong>Receive Webmentions</strong>
      (incoming webmentions) is enabled for your domain. This allows the service to
      accept and store mentions on your behalf.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Copy the Webmention and Pingback endpoint URLs that webmention.io shows for
      your domain. Add them to your site's template inside the
      <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> element, either by editing your custom template or by
      using the <em>Custom &gt; Head</em> setting:
    </p>
    <pre><code>&lt;link rel="webmention" href="https://webmention.io/yourdomain/webmention"&gt;
&lt;link rel="pingback" href="https://webmention.io/yourdomain/xmlrpc"&gt;
</code></pre>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Enable the <strong>Webmentions</strong> service on Blot's
      <a href="/settings/services">Services</a> page. Once enabled, Blot will load
      the widget on posts and display mentions automatically when webmention.io
      reports them for each URL.
    </p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>
  New mentions can take a few minutes to appear after they are received by
  webmention.io. The widget only appears on your site when there are mentions to
  show, so you can enable it ahead of time without affecting existing posts.
